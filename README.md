# AI External Triggerbot
really clunky external triggerbot that uses [Ultralytics' yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) I made months ago, works alright for what it is and it's fun to use to kill some bots, don't use this please I presume it'll 100% get you banned on any game with anticheat lol

while the hotkey is pressed, it just takes a screenshot of the middle of the desktop and if it detects a person it clicks the mouse
