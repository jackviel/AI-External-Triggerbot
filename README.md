# AI External Triggerbot
really clunky external triggerbot that uses [Ultralytics' yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5), works alright for what it is and it's fun to use to kill some bots, it'll 100% get you banned on every anti-cheat

while the hotkey is pressed, it just takes a screenshot of the middle of the desktop and if it detects a person it clicks the mouse
